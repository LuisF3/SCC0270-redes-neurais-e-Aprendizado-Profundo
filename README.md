# SCC0270 Neural networks and deep learning 01-2021

This repository contains the projects I did for the university subject of neural networks and depp learning. All further text is in Portuguese, but you can still open the .html files to visualze codes and graphics.

You can use this website https://htmlpreview.github.io/ to view the .html without downloading them if that is convenient to you
